# Meet and greet + Fun
### You are all required to go to Welcome Night and socialize.
```
Do come though, it's really fun. You'll end up in really nice photos
and you'll meet the rest of the club.
```

### Learn something new about your tier members
```
I'm a strong supporter of pair programming and team dynamic. You're
going to be learning a lot from each other so get to know everyone;
it makes things a lot more fun.
